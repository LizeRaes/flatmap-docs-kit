This tutorial explains how to visualize the ADK agent lifecycle using UML-style charts and ADK's internal event system.

```java
agent.on("init", () -> {
    logger.info("Agent initialized");
});
```
You’ll learn how to render transitions and triggers using the ADK’s lifecycle hooks and logging API.
